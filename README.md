Siddhant 2022

A flutter app developed for  inter-college/inter-school quiz competition held in my college.This is my first production level app created in flutter so obviously this is not the place to look for good practices. This app had to be completed within 5-6 days so you can expect lot of patchy stuff.I haven't used any state management library so you can a lot of hacky stuff to manage state .
I haven't tested this on IOS idk if it works on IOS most likely will work with minute modifications.
